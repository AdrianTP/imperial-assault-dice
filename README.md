Imperial Assault (and Other Games) Dice Probability Calculator (and Roller)
======
## Installation for Development

```sh
git clone <repo URL>
bower install
```

## Notes
* Needs some cleanup to meet my personal code organisation standards
* ...but it runs, so I'm not particularly worried about it right now

## Current Game Support
* Star Wars: Imperial Assault
* Star Wars: Armada
* Star Wars: X-Wing

## Usage Instructions
* To **use** the app, [click here](http://adriantp.github.io/imperial-assault-dice/app/)
* To **add** dice to the calculation pool, tap the corresponding die in the **Available** section
* To **remove** dice from the calculation pool, tap the corresponding die in the **Selected** section
* To **calculate the probabilities** of the dice in the calculation pool, tap the **Stats** button (which will only appear if there are dice in the pool, and if the pool has changed since the last calculation
* To **roll** the dice in the calculation pool, tap the **Roll** button (which only appears under the same circumstances as the Stats button)
* To **switch games**, tap the corresponding game icon at the bottom of the screen
* To **enter fullscreen mode**, tap the fullscreen icon (four arrows) in the upper-right corner of the screen next to the title bar
* To **pin** the app to your home screen, ask Google how to do that (I cannot list instructions for every device, operating system, operating system version, browser, and browser version here)

## Caveats
* I did not design the app to run on a desktop browser. It will run, it just won't look nice (not that it looks particularly nice normally -- it is rather spartan in its appearance)
* The app does not support comparing different groups of dice side-by-side
* The app does not support calculating attack vs. defence (chance to land a hit) -- that is left as an exercise for the player
